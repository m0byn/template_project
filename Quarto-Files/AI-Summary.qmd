# Summary of Strategy 1 Analysis Results

## Main Outcome Variables

**Strategy 1** examines four health outcomes using GOEG regional health indices:

1. **khHke**: Heart disease hospitalization rates per 100k population
2. **khStr**: Stroke hospitalization rates per 100k population  
3. **khOnc**: Cancer hospitalization rates per 100k population
4. **frShA65**: Hip fracture rates among 65+ population per 100k

## Specification 1a: Between-Region Analysis

### Heart Disease (khHke)
- **Physician density effects**: Inconsistent across approaches - positive in some specifications, negative in others
- **Heart specialist effects**: Generally negative but statistically insignificant
- **Key finding**: Demographics (elderly share) strongly predict heart disease rates
- **R² progression**: Low explanatory power (4-15%) without controls, high (68%) with full controls

### Stroke (khStr)  
- **Physician density effects**: Small positive effects, often insignificant
- **Stroke specialist effects**: Consistently negative and significant (-381 to -1,007 per share unit)
- **Key finding**: Strong demographic predictors, specialist composition matters more than density
- **R² progression**: Moderate baseline (6-27%), high with controls (76%)

### Cancer (khOnc)
- **Physician density effects**: Positive and significant in basic models, becomes insignificant with controls
- **Cancer specialist effects**: Negative but mostly insignificant
- **Key finding**: Income shows positive association with cancer rates (detection effect)
- **R² progression**: Low baseline (10-13%), moderate with controls (64%)

### Hip Fractures (frShA65)
- **Physician density effects**: Consistently negative, significant in full specifications
- **Hip specialist effects**: Positive but insignificant across specifications
- **Key finding**: Care infrastructure (pflegeG4b7) shows very strong positive association
- **R² progression**: Very low baseline (2%), low even with controls (27%)

## Specification 1b: Within-Region Contemporaneous Effects

### Key Patterns Across Outcomes:
- **Physician density changes**: Generally small, mostly insignificant effects
- **Specialist density changes**: Mixed results, often insignificant
- **Demographics**: Strong predictors when significant (elderly share, population composition)
- **High R²**: 93-95% due to district fixed effects absorbing time-invariant characteristics

### Outcome-Specific Findings:
- **Heart disease**: No significant physician effects, strong demographic effects
- **Stroke**: Minimal physician effects, demographic composition matters
- **Cancer**: Negative physician density effects (marginally significant)
- **Hip fractures**: No significant effects, care infrastructure important

## Specification 1c: Within-Region Medium-Term Analysis

### Lag Structure Effects:
- **Heart disease**: Positive lagged physician effects (t-1), stronger with demographics
- **Stroke**: Significant positive effects for both physician density and stroke specialists (t-2 lag)
- **Cancer**: Minimal lagged effects across specifications
- **Hip fractures**: No significant lagged effects

### Temporal Patterns:
- **Stroke shows clearest lagged responses**: t-2 specialist effects significant and substantial
- **Heart disease**: t-1 physician effects emerge with controls
- **Cancer and hip fractures**: Limited evidence of medium-term effects

## Differences and Similarities Between Outcomes

### Similarities:
- **Demographics dominate**: Elderly population share consistently predicts hospitalization rates
- **Specialist composition**: More important than total physician density
- **Control variable importance**: Results change substantially when adding demographic/health controls

### Differences:
- **Stroke**: Strongest and most consistent specialist effects
- **Heart disease**: Mixed physician effects, demographic dominance
- **Cancer**: Income effects suggest detection rather than treatment mechanisms
- **Hip fractures**: Weakest associations, care infrastructure most relevant

## Differences Between Strategies

### Specification 1a vs 1b:
- **1a (Between-region)**: Captures long-term equilibrium differences between regions
- **1b (Within-region)**: Captures short-term adjustment effects within regions
- **Effect magnitudes**: Generally larger in 1a, suggesting long-term adaptation

### Specification 1b vs 1c:
- **1b (Contemporaneous)**: Immediate effects of density changes
- **1c (Lagged)**: Medium-term effects allowing for adjustment
- **Temporal dynamics**: 1c reveals delayed responses, particularly for stroke

## Strategy-Specific Conclusions

### Specification 1a Conclusion:
Between-region analysis reveals that **specialist composition matters more than total physician density** for most outcomes. Stroke shows the strongest evidence for specialist effectiveness, while demographic factors dominate across all conditions. The analysis suggests long-term regional differences in health outcomes are primarily driven by population characteristics rather than physician supply.

### Specification 1b Conclusion:
Within-region contemporaneous analysis shows **limited immediate effects of physician density changes** on health outcomes. The high explanatory power comes from district fixed effects, indicating that time-invariant regional characteristics are the primary determinants. Short-term physician supply changes do not translate into immediate health improvements.

### Specification 1c Conclusion:
Medium-term lagged analysis reveals **delayed responses vary by condition**. Stroke demonstrates the clearest evidence of beneficial specialist effects with 2-year lags, while heart disease shows modest 1-year physician effects. Cancer and hip fractures show minimal medium-term responses, suggesting these conditions may require different analytical approaches or longer observation periods.

## Overall Conclusion:

**Strategy 1** provides mixed evidence for physician density effects on regional health outcomes. **Specialist composition consistently outperforms total density** as a predictor, with stroke care showing the strongest evidence for specialist effectiveness. **Demographic factors dominate** across all specifications, suggesting that population characteristics are more important than physician supply for explaining regional health outcome variations. The **temporal analysis reveals condition-specific lag structures**, with stroke showing the clearest delayed benefits from specialist availability. These findings suggest that **targeted specialist deployment rather than general physician density increases** may be more effective for improving population health outcomes.
